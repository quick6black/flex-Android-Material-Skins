I am using all actionscript, so component colors can be configured in CSS. 

If anyone would like to contribute, create a pull request, or if you want a component skinned open an issue

animations are being added in based on https://github.com/rui-cruz/Spark-Material collaboration will take place 
to merge the 2 repositories for a complete set of desktop and mobile skins. Great inkRipple Class Rui!!!!
